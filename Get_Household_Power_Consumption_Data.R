### MODIFIED: 08/09/2015 Changed to use /ExData_Plotting1/.data
### NOTE:     This project has a 20 meg datafile that must be ignored by git/GitHub.
### NOTE:     .data folder is intended to be both "hidden" and ignored by git/GitHub.
### NOTE:     Creating an RStudio project will create ".gitignore".
### NOTE:     MUST edit ".gitignore" to add /data and /.data directories.

### NOTE:     This program has a KISS/brute force philosophy
### NOTE:     though it is possible to read directly from .zip; we unzip to .txt.


### descr has the file.head function for dumping the first few lines of a file without interpretation
require(descr)

### If you comment out this specific setwd(); use the getwd() to note what directory you are in.
setwd("C:/Users/Jim/Documents/GitHub/ExData_Plotting1/.data")

### Where am I? (in the directory tree -- useful for debugging file string)
getwd()

### What is the date? (useful for bibliography: retrieved URL on date)
dateDownloaded <- date()

### Get Household Power Consumption Data Zip file
url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip"
download.file(url,'~\\GitHub\\ExData_Plotting1\\.data\\exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip', mode="wb")

### Unzip the data file
unzip("~\\GitHub\\ExData_Plotting1\\.data\\exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip", 
      overwrite = TRUE, exdir = ".", unzip = "internal", setTimes = TRUE)

## dump the first few lines of file using file.head() from the descr package
## could have used readlines() for this, but easier to remember head and file.head .
file.head("~\\GitHub\\ExData_Plotting1\\.data\\household_power_consumption.txt")

### Data file should be downloaded and unzipped; ready for next program read into R.
